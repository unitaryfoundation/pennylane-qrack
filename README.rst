PennyLane-Qrack Plugin
#######################

.. header-start-inclusion-marker-do-not-remove

The PennyLane-Qrack plugin integrates the Qrack quantum computing framework with PennyLane's quantum machine learning capabilities.

**Performance can benefit greatly from following the `Qrack repository "Quick Start" and "Power user considerations." <https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack/blob/main/README.md#quick-start>`__ **

This plugin is addapted from the `PennyLane-Qulacs plugin, <https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane-qulacs>`__ under the Apache License 2.0, with many thanks to the original developers!

`PennyLane <https://pennylane.readthedocs.io>`__ is a cross-platform Python library for quantum machine learning, automatic differentiation, and optimization of hybrid quantum-classical computations.

`unitaryfund/qrack <https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack>`__ (formerly **vm6502q/qrack**) is a software library for quantum computing, written in C++ and with GPU support.

`PennyLane Catalyst <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/index.html>`__ provides optional quantum just-in-time (QJIT) compilation, for improved performance.

Features
========

* Provides access to a PyQrack simulator backend via the ``qrack.simulator`` device
* Provides access to a (C++) Qrack simulator backend for Catalyst (also) via the ``qrack.simulator`` device

Installation
============

This plugin requires Python version 3.9 or above, as well as PennyLane and the Qrack library.

Installation of this plugin as well as all its Python dependencies can be done using ``pip`` (or ``pip3``, as appropriate):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip3 install pennylane-qrack

This step should automatically build the latest ``main`` branch Qrack library, for Catalyst support, if Catalyst support is available.

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PennyLane-Qrack requires the following libraries be installed:

* `Python <http://python.org/>`__ >= 3.9
* `Qrack <https://github.com/unitaryfund/qrack>`__ >= 9.0

as well as the following Python packages:

* `PennyLane <http://pennylane.readthedocs.io/>`__ >= 0.32
* `PyQrack <https://github.com/vm6502q/pyqrack>`__  >= 1.28.0

with optional functionality provided by the following Python packages:

* `Catalyst <https://docs.pennylane.ai/projects/catalyst/en/stable/index.html>`__ >= 0.7


If you currently do not have Python 3 installed, we recommend
`Anaconda for Python 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/download/>`__, a distributed version of Python packaged
for scientific computation.
